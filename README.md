# start-p5 PUBLIC

A template repository for setting up a local server and p5.js project. This branch has `public` files only. You may use [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [`atom-html-preview`](https://github.com/harmsk/atom-html-preview) to preview the sketch within the editor instead of setting up the local server yourself.

## Get Started

0. Install [Atom](https://atom.io/) and use its package installer to install **Preview HTML**.
1. Download (clone) this repository to your computer.

```shell
git clone -b public https://github.com/peilingjiang/start-p5.git
```

2. **(Optional)** Download the p5.js library files locally. Run the following command in Terminal. You can then go to `index.html` and comment out lines using CDN files and uncomment lines using local files.

```shell
# Change directory into the repository folder
cd start-p5
```

```shell
# For Mac users
source setup.sh
# For Windows users
./setup.sh
```

3. Use **Preview HTML** to preview the sketch inside the editor
